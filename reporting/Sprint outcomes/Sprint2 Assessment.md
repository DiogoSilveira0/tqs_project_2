# Sprint 2 Assessment - 15/05/2020

## Achievements

1. All the Search API features.
2. First Login API feature.
3. QA Manual is mostly complete (CI/CD section needs to be developed further for the final delivery), nonetheless we were able to deliver a solid draft for this iteration.
4. Architecture section in the Product Specification Report.
5. Web client app infrastructure.
6. Created a mock external publisher to be used as a placeholder in the CD pipeline until the needed endpoints are developed.


## Missing
1. Order API features are delayed (Comprador consulta o seu histórico de encomendas + Comprador consulta uma encomenda específica através do seu código)
2. Search UI is underway, we predicted that this would take more than a week from the beginning, since it was dependent on the progress of the Search API being able to deliver working endpoints
